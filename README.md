# poetry_app


This is a poetry app developed in java which uses local API which was created using WAMP with PHP.

This app is based on how to get data from local api which was created using the WAMP with the help of the PHP. Currently as of now the api's which was created are not available here but soon it will be there for proper understanding.

Basically, this app is made for the poetry which can be created, deleted and as well as can also be upgraded from the local api. This is the whole concept behind this app.
